# MSc Drone Notebooks
This Repo contains a number of Jupyter Notebooks (for the moment) running python scripts with markdown descriptions inbetween. Each Notebook project has most likely been created to aid in solving, visualizing or presenting information and research progress to achieve the final goal of my Masters Degree Project, building a drone for science. Cool name coming soon :)

## Description of Notebook Projects
### leg-beam-analysis
This notebook details static and dynamic analysis of the stress within the rotor boom, depending on the location of landing gear attachment along the rotor boom. Further details and images can be found in the notebook.

### solidworks-sim-displayer
This notebook is a visualization tool and is used to extract data from `.csv` files produced by [SOLIDWORKS](https://www.solidworks.com/) design studies. The notebook peforms some data cleaning before storing the data in a `pandas` dataframe and allowing the user to use a visualization library like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to plot the data.
